        <p><b>Nigiri sushi</b> is a classic Japanese dish, this begins with a raw fish such as tuna or salmon which will be sliced into thin pieces. Next is preparing rice by cooking a short-grain rice and for seasoning we need a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar and salt while it's still warm. Make your hands slightly wet and shape the rice into oval balls and gently apply pressure for it to hold. Put a dap of wasabi on top the finest sushi rice and put a slice of fish on top of each rice balls and end it with a thin strip of nori or brush it with soy sauce. Then end it with eating your fine nigiri sushi dish. </p>
