        <p>I think I'm gonna like this show. Violent, irreverent, entertaining. Seems like it will be able to hit all the same marks as "the boys" but without budget limitations. Which is awesome. And the star power of this show is incredible. Seriously look at that cast list. I'll definitely be eagerly awaiting new episodes.</p>
