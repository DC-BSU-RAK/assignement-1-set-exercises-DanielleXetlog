      <p>I think I'm gonna like this show. Violent, irreverent, entertaining. Seems like it will be able to hit all the same marks as "the boys" but without budget limitations. Which is awesome. And the star power of this show is incredible. Seriously look at that cast list. I'll definitely be eagerly awaiting new episodes.</p>

      <p>Spectacular voice acting, animation, and writing, the amount of effort and care put into this series is evident. Each character is so complex and well rounded, and mixed with the incredible voice acting every character seems like a genuine person that you can empathize with...</p>

      <p>If you were into "The Boys" you will definitely be into this show, a realistic version of what superior beings would actually be like. Blood and gore check, great voice actors check, fantastic soundtrack check (recent episode included a track from the group Nine Inch Nails), great story check and dialogue that actually feels important and emotionally powerful...</p>
